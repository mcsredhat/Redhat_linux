1. Check File Ownership and Permissions
Ensure that the zone file (/var/named/linuxcbt.internal) is owned by the named user and group, as BIND runs under the named user.

Run the following commands:

bash
Copy code
sudo chown named:named /var/named/linuxcbt.internal
sudo chmod 640 /var/named/linuxcbt.internal
chown named:named ensures that the named user and group own the zone file.
chmod 640 sets read and write permissions for the owner and read permissions for the group, which is sufficient for BIND to read the file.
2. Verify SELinux Configuration
If SELinux is enabled, it may be preventing BIND from accessing the zone file. You can check the current SELinux status using:

bash
Copy code
sestatus
If SELinux is enforcing, run the following to apply the correct SELinux context to the zone file:

bash
Copy code
sudo restorecon -v /var/named/linuxcbt.internal
Alternatively, you can manually apply the context:

bash
Copy code
sudo chcon -t named_zone_t /var/named/linuxcbt.internal
3. Check named.conf File
Ensure that the named.conf file correctly points to the zone file:

bash
Copy code
zone "linuxcbt.internal" {
    type master;
    file "/var/named/linuxcbt.internal";
    allow-update { none; };
};
The path in the file directive should match the actual location of the zone file.

4. Restart BIND
After making the necessary changes, restart the BIND service:

bash
Copy code
sudo systemctl restart named
5. Check Logs
Monitor the logs to verify if the issue is resolved:

bash
Copy code
sudo tail -f /var/log/messages
This should help you identify any further errors related to permissions or misconfiguration.
